**Port Scanner**

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the Nmap tool for port scanning.

The script allows you to discover open ports, services, and other information about a target IP address. The IP address found in the script is a test target machine courtesy of nmap.org. You will also need to replace the nmap path.exe with the actual path.
